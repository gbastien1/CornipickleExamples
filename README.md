##Work in progress

###Guidelines:
Uses Gnome's human interface guidelines which can be found here:
https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/ui-elements.html.en

The goal is to be able to express every guideline in the cornichon language from the Cornipickle program in order to, later, automatically verify web page layouts according to these guidelines.


###Webpages:
Using cornichon to detect and highlight bugs in "real" webpages (captured with the mozilla MAFF format).
